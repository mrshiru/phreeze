PLEASE NOTE - PHREEZE HAS MOVED TO https://github.com/jasonhinkle/phreeze

This code will remain here in case any existing apps are dependent on it, however it is recommended that you pull from the git repo on github.  The latest Phreeze on git is mostly backwards compatible with this version, however you will need to bring the /scripts/ directory with you in order to support old applications with the current version of Phreeze.

Phreeze is a lightweight MVC + ORM + code generator for PHP
